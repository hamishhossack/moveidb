## Get Started
 ```npm install webpack -g```
 ```npm setup```

## Requirements
The solution has to be provided as a Git repository including all the implementation commits history. Please follow the frequent commit practice while working on the task so that your local Git repository indicates reasonable milestones of your implementation. You are more than welcome to share your Git repository on a free service such as GitHub or BitBucket

The repository should contain:
1. Source code with no binaries.
a. It should be buildable/viewable
b. In case you need to use external libraries, please add them
2. Any installation and deployment instructions for apps and components
